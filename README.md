# ComfyUI-GeekyRemB
Custom Background Remover for ComfyUI to address some issues I've encountered with different background removers. 

GeekyRemb: Advanced Background Removal Node
This custom node provides a powerful and flexible tool for removing backgrounds from images within ComfyUI workflows. It combines multiple techniques and offers various options for fine-tuning the background removal process.
How to Use:

Connect an image output from a previous node to the "images" input of GeekyRemb.
Optionally, connect a mask to the "mask" input if you want to guide the background removal.
Adjust the settings as needed for your specific use case.
The node will output the processed image(s) with the background removed.
